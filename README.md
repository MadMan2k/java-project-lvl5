# Tasker application

### About

Small Spring application for your team tasks management

This application is a part of my project at [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/). It's fully functional and ready to use. All back-end part is made by me and a front-end part is provided by [Hexlet](https://ru.hexlet.io/)

Feel free if you want to use my application! It's all explicitly in the public domain (I have to formally say that). You can grab a copy of the files to use and tweak as fits you best or use it as it is.

Check demo version on [Heroku](https://task3r-app.herokuapp.com/)
